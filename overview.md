### Exam Content
Response Types
There are two types of questions on the examination:
 Multiple-choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors).
 Multiple-response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more options.
Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or incorrect
answers, are response options that an examinee with incomplete knowledge or skill would likely choose. However,
they are generally plausible responses that fit in the content area defined by the test objective.
Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing.
Unscored Content
Your examination may include non-scored questions that are placed on the test to gather statistical information.
These questions are not identified on the form, and do not affect your score.
Exam Results
The AWS Certified Developer-Associate Examination (DVA-C01) is a pass or fail exam. The examination is scored
against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals guided by certification industry best practices and
guidelines.
Your results for the examination are reported as a score from 100 - 1000, with a minimum passing score of 720.
Your score shows how you performed on the examination as a whole and whether or not you passed. Scaled
scoring models are used to equate scores across multiple exam forms that may have slightly different difficulty
levels.
Your score report contains a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. This information is
designed to provide general feedback concerning your examination performance. The examination uses a
compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to “pass” the individual sections, only the overall
examination. Each section of the examination has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than
others. The table contains general information, highlighting your strengths and weaknesses. Exercise caution when
interpreting section-level feedback.
